# WED5020-POE-PART 3
For the WEDE5020-POE-PART3 project, I developed a comprehensive website using Visual Studio Code.  
I created a dedicated JavaScript folder named Mymain to organize all JavaScript files.
Each HTML page was linked to its respective JavaScript file, including checkout.js, products.js, aboutus.js, contactus.js, and thankyou.js, to manage dynamic content and interactivity.
I also integrated a styled interactive map with a corresponding map.js script. 
The sign-up and login forms were edited and repurposed to serve as the homepage of the website. 
To enhance readability and maintainability, I added comments throughout the HTML files. 
Finally, I included screenshots of all pages within the images folder to visually document the project's progress and layout.
